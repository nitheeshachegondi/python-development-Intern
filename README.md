Assignment: 

1. Write a Python function that takes a string as input and reverses it but with a twist: every vowel in the reversed string should be capitalized, and every consonant should be converted to lowercase. For example, if the input is "Hello, World!", the output should be "!dLrOw ,oLlEh".

2. Design a Python function that takes a list of elements as input and returns the count of unique elements in the list. The function should not utilize any built-in Python libraries or functions related to counting or sets. 

3. Query Writing Challenge:
Consider a table orders with columns order_id, customer_id, order_date, and total_amount. Write a SQL query to calculate the total revenue generated in the last quarter, grouped by month.
